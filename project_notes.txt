NEED TO SET UP NEW PROJECT REPO!!!

if only 1 user and user = me, then can I "password-protect" it?





seed file only needs 6-7 items at the beginning for testing

will create a new directory on local and name a repo in Github as the same; git init local directory

account.transactions.each --> will run through all the transactions

do credit/debit as Boolean

end question = what's the logic to figure out current_balance
	--> getting class definitions to work as they should / do what you want them to do
	--> (work on & test class definitions in pry)
	--> figure out and get account/transactions working, and then move to adding in users.
	--> class methods will only be acting on a single object
	--> Andy cares least about UI

the fridge is a good example for setting it up relationship-wise, because it's food/drink taken into/out of the fridge

Andy: don't worry about testing for this, other than in pry

BABY STEPS!
1) figure out schema and how models will interact with each other
2) get some seed data so as to be able to start playing around/testing in pry (~ 2 accounts, 3 transactions each)





schema.sql -- "amount" attribute -- "MONEY" data type SHOULD work --> switch to it later! (requires 2 decimal points?)
